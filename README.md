# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The motivation behind this application was to generate a Web page that display team member's information. The reason why I built this application was to create team profile generator to help developer teams show who's in their team the names, email addresses and more bit of information about them. The problem that my application solves is it gives you a template html file with all the team members information rather than making it on your own. What I learned from the making of this application was when install inquirer the least version is not always going to working on every application.
